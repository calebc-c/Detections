# Detection Engineering Repository

A living repository of detection rules, queries, and threat hunting content across multiple platforms and security tools.

This is an ongoing work in progress. New materials will be uploaded regularly as threat actors evolve their tactics and as I continue building and refining detections. 

## Structure

This repository is organized by platform, SIEM tools, and threat categories 

### Platforms
- **Windows**: Sysmon, Event Logs, PowerShell
- **Linux**: syslog, process monitoring
- **macOS**: Endpoint Security framework
- **Cloud**: AWS, Azure, GCP
